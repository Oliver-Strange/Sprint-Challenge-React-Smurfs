1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Client-side routing is done within the app/browser. Most data is loaded before the app renders and allows for navigation without calling to a server. Downside can be long initial loading time if the internet is slow.

    Server-side routing is the communication back and forth between the app/browser and the server where the data is stored. Reloads page after every navigation because it has to call the server for the data.
